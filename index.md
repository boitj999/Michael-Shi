# Object Detection with Raspberry Pi
This will serve as a brief description of your project. Limit this to three sentences because it can become overly long at that point. This copy should draw the user in and make she/him want to read more.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was to successfully set up my raspberry pi and have it run on my monitor. To do this, I first needed to download a raspberry pi imager on my mac. I then put an SD card into a card reader and plugged it in my mac. After successfully writing the operating systems on my SD card, I then proceeded to take it out of my mac and plugged it in my raspberry pi. While I recieved a wireless mouse and keyboard, I decided to not waste time on connecting it to my raspberry pi and used a keyboard and mouse of my own instead. I then found a moniter that nobody in my house used and attached the cable into my moniter and the raspberry pi. Finally, I had to give the raspberry pi power and plugged it accordingly. After
