# Object Detection with Raspberry Pi
This will serve as a brief description of your project. Limit this to three sentences because it can become overly long at that point. This copy should draw the user in and make she/him want to read more.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was to get the raspberry pi camera to function with tflite. I had multiple challenges trying to get it to work. The first challenge I encountered was being able to download and successfully import tflite onto my raspberry pi. I kept getting the error: TypeError: create_from_options(): incompatible function arguments. I followed many different videos to try to get it to work but the error still remained. I even thought it was my python version that was causing the error. I ultimately fixed this problem by realizing that I needed to use the correct tflite-support version. I fixed it thanks to this link: https://discuss.tensorflow.org/t/problem-in-tensorflowlite-code-with-pyhton-and-flask-on-google-coral-dev-board-for-object-detection/10302. After successfully importing tflite, I set up the raspberry pi camera to my raspberry pi.
